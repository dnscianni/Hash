 * Programming Assignment #3
 *
 * This assignment is to help us learn hash tables and
 * sorting algorithms. We are to make two hash tables,
 * one using additive hashing, and the other using
 * rotational hashing.  Then we are to create a registry
 * program that utilizes the hash table to keep a table
 * of students. We also have to have a sorting method
 * in each hash table to sort them out and return a sorted
 * array.
